= Introduction
Here are some citations to previous work @Dyson1920 and other
work @Abbot2016.

= Background/Theory
A simple equation to calculate mean is given by:

$ overline(x) = frac(sum_(i = i)^n x_i, n) $ <eq:mean>


When introducing an equation, it is important to define the variables used. For example, it is unclear what $n$ stands for in @eq:mean[Eq.] (note: a reference to the above equation is made here).

= Experimental Details

    Measured time vs. distance for Lindsayâ€™s bike ride home one evening.
    Red points indicate measured times, with error bars indicating the
    estimated measurement uncertainty of each point (some error bars are
    smaller than marker size).

<fig:setup>

The apparatus used in the CVGT experiment is the remnant of a mercury
manometer equipped with an air-filled glass bulb placed inside a copper
canister (see @fig:setup).

= Results and Analysis
Data is included in @table:data-table provided in the
Appendix section.
